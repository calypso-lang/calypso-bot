# Calypso Bot

A discord bot that interacts with Calypso (in the future) and some lambda calc implementations (currently just [SysF](https://github.com/ThePuzzlemaker/sysf-rs)).

A configuration file is required to be in `./config.toml`. See [`config.example.toml`](./config.example.toml) for an example of such.
